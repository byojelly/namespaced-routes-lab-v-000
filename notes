Create a Preference model that will store preferences for the app. It will need to have fields for:

# rails g model Preference artist_sort_order:string song_sort_order:string allow_create_artists:boolean allow_create_songs:boolean --no-test-framework
# rake db:migrate
# rake db:seed


          Song sort order (e.g. "ASC" or "DESC"). This will be used to control the default sort order on the /songs page.


          Artist sort order. This will be used to control the default sort order on the /artists page.


          Allowing creation of new songs. Used to control the ability to add new songs to the system.


          Allowing creation of new artists. Used to control the ability to add new artists to the system.


Create a PreferencesController, routes, and views to manage the preferences. Do this under an Admin module to separate it from the standard user functionality.
          #app/controllers/admin/preferences_controller.rb
                  #with distinguishing that the class is a module


          #modify app/config.routes.rb file with namespace for admin

          #app/views/admin/preferences
          #setup views/admin/preferences/index.html.erb file
                #create a form to enable/disable admin preference
                #this form_for uses radio buttons to manipulate the admin preferences
          #PreferencesController setup index action so that view file can work off the @preference through a first_or_create action

          #lets be able to update the preferences
                #in our config/routes.rb file, include :update in our namespace preferences resources
                #in our PreferencesController, add a private strong params action called preference_params that allows us to change the instances attributes
                #in our PreferencesController, add an update action that
                        #finds the current params being worked on
                        #updates with strong params
                        #redirects back to the preferences index page






Update the artists and songs index pages to order by name according to each preference.


Update the songs#new and artists#new actions to check that creating new songs or artists is enabled, and redirect to /songs and /artists, respectively, if that preference is disabled.


Make sure tests pass.


Ride the bull. Feel the flow.
